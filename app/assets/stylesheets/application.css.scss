// This is a manifest file that will be compiled to include all the files listed below.
// http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#manifest-files-and-directives
// 
// IT'S NOT ADVISABLE TO ADD CODE DIRECTLY TO THIS FILE.
// 
// When you add a file to this directory, manually add it to this manifest file.
// Doing this rather than requiring the entire tree allows us to keep a tight control
// on our css stack, eliminating errors/frustrations/headaches that arise from trying
// to override styles and debug where a property was inherited from.
// 
// Remember that files to be pulled into this manifest can reside in three places:
// 
// - app/assets/stylesheets
// - vendor/assets/stylesheets
// - lib/assets/stylesheets
// 
// For a breakdown of what belongs where, see
// http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#asset-organization
